# Rules

## Goal

The goal of the game is to have the last remaining secret intact card. The winner should be able to reveal their card at the end of the game, thus declaring victory.

## The Five Rules

1. How To Win
A player wins by being the "last man standing" with an unrevealed, intact card.
"Unrevealed" means that they have not been OFFICIALLY accused of having their specific card.
"Intact" means that the card is in one piece, and that the card face is still readable.
  - If the face of a card cannot be read, it is not intact.
  - If a card is ripped into pieces that cannot be held together, it is not intact.
Players must also not be OUT.

3. How To Get People OUT

  - OFFICIAL Accusations
    - A player can OFFICIALLY accuse another player of having or not having a specific card.
  - Destroying a Card
  - Voluntarily Quitting
    - Players can quit voluntarily at any time by:
      -  saying "I OFFICIALLY quit"
      -  OFFICIALLY accusing themselves of having a correct or incorrect card
      -  Destroying their own card
      -  or otherwise quitting. Players cannot get out by violating Rule Three.
  - Players should not get other players out by forcing them to violate the socially enforced rules; doing so is usually a violation of the socially enforced rules.

3. Socially Enforced Rules ("Rule Three")
Any unwritten rules of "PERSUASION!" are enforced by the players and any surrounding hosts, non-players, or society at large. If everyone agrees you violated the socially enforced rules, you are OUT, so don't try.

4. Second-Place Rule
When only two players remain, the remaining cards are typically obvious. However, if this is not the case after a few minutes:
  - The last remaining player to get someone OUT is declared the winner.
  - If this is not the case, a social poll is taken to determine if there is a clear winner.
  - If there is not a clear winner, the game continues until a winner is declared, or until the time limit expires.

6. Time Limit
A time limit must be established before the game begins (the recommended time limit is 90 minutes).
  - If a time limit is not established, the game will drag and not be as fun.
  - If the time limit expires without a winner, the game ends and everyone loses equally. Try being more persuasive next time!
